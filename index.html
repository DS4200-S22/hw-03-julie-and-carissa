    <div class="chartgrid">

            <p>
                The data type that is being used in this type of chart are both quantitative and categorical. 
                Since there are numbers being used for both the x and y axes, that means there must be quantifiable data. 
                However, there are also colors being used to describe discrete categories, meaning the data must also be categorical (orange, red, blue). 
                The marks being used here is area, while the channels are color, size, and x/y position. Additionally, the marks are used as items.
            </p>

        <div id="chart">
            <img src="img/bump_chart.png" alt="Bump Chart" />
            <p>
               The data type that is being used here is sequential and categorical. Since we are measuring changes over time, that is sequential data. 
               However, there are also only 5 categories that the data can belong to, making the data categorical as well. 
               The marks being used are points as well as lines being used as links between the points (which are items), and the channels are color and tilt/position.  
            </p>

        <div id="chart">
            <img src="img/mind_map.png" alt="Mind Map" />
            <p>
                This mind map uses categorical data. 
                Based on the colors and labels (theme, category, idea) as well as red, orange, and blue, it seems as if data can only fall into those categories. The marks are both points and lines, where the lines are used as links and the points are items. The channels used are color, x/y position, curve, and tilt.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="chart">
            <img src="img/stacked_bar_chart.png" alt="Stacked Bar Chart" />
            <p>
                The data are categorical attributes (A, B, C, D). The marks are areas (bars) so they're 2D and the channels used are position, color, size, and area.
